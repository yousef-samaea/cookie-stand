    <p class="h1">Salmon /ˈsæmən/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling, and whitefish.
         Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus).
          Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. 
          Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.</p>
